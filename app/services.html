    The doctype declaration should be the very first thing in an HTML
    document, before the tag. The doctype declaration is not an HTML tag;
    it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of the
    markup language the page is written in. In the case of <!DOCTYPE html>,
    we are declaring that the version of HTML is HTML5.

     The HTML lang attribute can be used to declare the language of a Web page
     or a portion of a Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.

     The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is
     placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag. HTML metadata is data
     about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed. Metadata typically
     define the document title, character set, styles, links, scripts, and
     other meta information.

         of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
         The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded
         by the browser.

         Other styles that are not critical should be lazy loaded to prevent the blocking
